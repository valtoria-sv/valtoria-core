# Architecture Overview

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of the architecture of the blockchain application built in Rust. The application is designed to be modular, secure, and efficient, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.

## Components

### 1. Blockchain

The core component of the application, responsible for managing the blockchain's state, including blocks and transactions. It ensures data integrity and implements consensus algorithms.

### 2. Wallet

The wallet module handles user accounts, keys, and transaction management. It includes features for creating stealth addresses to enhance privacy.

### 3. Mining

The mining component is responsible for creating new blocks in the blockchain. It implements the proof-of-work consensus algorithm to ensure security and prevent double-spending.

### 4. Networking

The networking module facilitates communication between nodes in the network. It handles peer discovery, message broadcasting, and synchronization of blockchain data.

### 5. API

The API module exposes HTTP endpoints for interaction with the blockchain and wallet functionalities. It supports both JSON-RPC and RESTful APIs.

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the wallet via the API to send/receive transactions.
2. **Transaction Processing**: Transactions are validated and added to the transaction pool.
3. **Mining**: Miners select transactions from the pool and create new blocks.
4. **Consensus**: The blockchain verifies and reaches consensus on the validity of new blocks.
5. **State Update**: The blockchain state is updated, reflecting the new transactions and blocks.

## Conclusion

The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing for easy updates and enhancements. Each component can be developed and tested independently, promoting a robust development process.
